# google-homepage

This assignment was initiated as a part of theodinproject.com. The goal was to mimick the google homepage as closely as possible. It was not
required to make links active or to include any bells and whistles (I included a few). This is my first project as a continue on my coding/
programing journey. There's so muc to learn!
